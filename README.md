# JRest - Java Rest Framework

current version: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

# Project is still under development


**JRest** is a Lightweight Java Rest framework for managing a simple and lightweight RESTfull backend service. The concepts are somewhat similar to `Express.js` for `Node.js`. The framework is built on top of `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` and is not production-ready due to the limitations of the said API.

In the future, I hope to implement a more stable and production-ready version of the framework by using other 3rd party HTTP libraries or by implementing a custom HTTP server.
